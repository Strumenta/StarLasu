# Starlasu
This project contains the documentation on the Starlasu approach, which is 
published [here](https://github.com/Strumenta/StarLasu/tree/main/documentation).

## Publication

We generate the documentation to be published using JetBrains's Writerside.

Updating the published version requires manually uploading the generated files to Netlify. At the moment Federico is the only one who has access.
