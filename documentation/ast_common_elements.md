# AST Common Elements

Most programming languages share some concepts. We identified these common concepts and defined marker for them. In this way, we can treat these elements similary in all languages.

They are:

* Statement: for example print statements, expression statements, or return statements
* Expression: for example, literals, mathematical expressions, boolean expressions
* Entity Declaration: for example, class declarations, top level function declarations
