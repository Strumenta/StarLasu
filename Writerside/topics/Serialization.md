# Serialization

In addition to what is described here, there is also EMF serialization, which is discussed separately. See [EMF](EMFInteroperability.md).

StarLasu supports exporting ASTs to JSON and XML. 
Additionally, kolasu supports import/export from the [Lionweb](https://github.com/Strumenta/kolasu/blob/main/lionweb/src/main/kotlin/com/strumenta/kolasu/lionweb/LionWebModelConverter.kt) format. 

_See in [Kolasu](https://github.com/Strumenta/kolasu/tree/main/serialization/src/main/kotlin)_.
