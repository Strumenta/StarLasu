# Serialization

In addition to what is described here, there is also EMF serialization, which is discussed separately. See [EMF](EMFInteroperability.md).

StarLasu Tools supports exporting ASTs to JSON and XML. 
Additionally, [kolasu](https://github.com/Strumenta/kolasu/blob/main/lionweb/src/main/kotlin/com/strumenta/kolasu/lionweb/LionWebModelConverter.kt) and [tylasu](https://github.com/Strumenta/tylasu/blob/master/src/interop/lionweb.ts) support import/export from the LionWeb format 

_See in [Kolasu](https://github.com/Strumenta/kolasu/tree/main/serialization/src/main/kotlin)_.
