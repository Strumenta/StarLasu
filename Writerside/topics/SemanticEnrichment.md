# Semantic Enrichment

_To be written_

Symbol Resolution is the process of giving a meaning to the each name in the source 
code. For example:

* to connect a given use of a variable to its declaration; 
* * to reconstruct the definition of a SQL column from an alias in a subquery; 
* * to identify a user-defined therapy plan in a medical support DSL.

Symbol resolution relies on the naming facilities in StarLasu.
